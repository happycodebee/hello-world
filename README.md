all things work unless they should
Raised on biographies, if-statements, and Louis L'Amour novels. Work history involves testing structural tape, running an atomic force microscope, and calculating postage.  Also a bit of Tyrannosaurus Visual Basic. Hobbies include birthday photo slideshows and dividend investing.
